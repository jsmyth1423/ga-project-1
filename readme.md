# Space Invaders - SEI Project 1

## Overview

Space Invaders is a  simple arcade game in which you control a gun turret at the bottom of the play area, only being able to move left and right while attempting to stop the aliens from reaching you. This is achieved by shooting them with a laser and dodging the bombs that they drop. This was a solo project built over a week mostly using JavaScript but also interaction with HTML and CSS.
