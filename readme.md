# Space Invaders - SEI Project 1

## Overview

Space Invaders is a  simple arcade game in which you control a gun turret at the bottom of the play area, only being able to move left and right while attempting to stop the aliens from reaching you. This is achieved by shooting them with a laser and dodging the bombs that they drop. This was a solo project built over a week mostly using JavaScript but also interaction with HTML and CSS.

**Controls:**  
Left and Right arrow keys to move  
C to shoot


## The Task:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
